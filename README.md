- **Multi-page navigation** — a nav bar linking to dedicated Drinks and Pastries pages, keeping content cleanly separated.
- **Image carousel/slider** — a rotating hero section showcasing the café's interior, coffee beans, and latte art with previous/next controls.
- **Terminal-inspired branding** — A Hidden Easter-Egg which leans into a developer aesthetic.
- **Responsive hero images with text overlays** — full-width lifestyle photography with descriptive captions baked into the images.
- **Social media links** — footer links to Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
- **Thematic copywriting** — the tagline "It's time to change the root of your trajectory with coffee" ties the tech theme into the brand voice.
